# Kwanko Tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

The Kwanko Tag allows advertisers to store a server-side cookie and send a conversion event (S2S) to [Kwanko](https://www.kwanko.com/ "Kwanko's Homepage").

This tag tracks three events types:
- `page_view` reads Kwanko's query parameter from the URL (`kwks2s`) and stores it on a server-side cookie named `kwk`
- `purchase` sends the event to Kwanko
- `generate_lad` sends the event to Kwanko
